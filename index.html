      <p><em>Varna Dance Theater</em> is a cultural organization based in Varna, Bulgaria, and operating in the field of
        contemporary dance. It was launched in the spring of 2018 by two Varna-born dancers and cultural managers who
        had returned home
        after spending years abroad. Through our work we aspire to make contemporary dance an integral part of the
        cultural landscape of the city. It is our desire to contribute to the development of the performing arts in
        Varna, while giving
        talented choreographers and dancers an opportunity for professional growth.</p>
      <p><em>Varna Dance Theater</em>’s debut performance The Notice Board took place on July, 14, 2018 at the stage of
        Varna Opera House. Subsequently the production was supported by the Ministry of Culture of Bulgaria and selected
        to participate
        in Theatres’ Night – Varna 2018. In May 2019 <em>Varna Dance Theater</em> traveled to Edirne, Turkey, to show
        the performance at the behest of Trakya University and as part of the cultural program of the Bulgarian
        Consulate.</p>
      <p>In July 2019, <em>Varna Dance Theater</em> conducted the first edition of Dance Routes – a contemporary dance
        festival aimed at bringing international dance experience and practices to Varna with the aid of dance
        professionals whose
        artistic journey
        has somehow been connected to the city.</p>
